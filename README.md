# Not The Grass!

Do you ever swing at a baby zombie only to hit the flower it is standing in? Trying to hit that creeper in the tall grass before it blows a hole in your front lawn? Look no further, because with this mod never again will you find yourself saying "Not the Grass!"

## Features
* Allows you to swing at entities when they occupy the same space as a block
* By default you are able to swing through all blocks that are [`minecraft:sword_efficient`](https://frontiernav.net/explore/minecraft/visualisations/tables/entities/sword-efficient) except for [`minecraft:carved_pumpkin`](https://frontiernav.net/explore/minecraft/visualisations/tables/entities/carved-pumpkin) these settings can be adjusted in the NotTheGrass-common.toml
* By default attacking the mob will cancel the break action (for example if you attack a mob that is in tall grass the tall grass will not break), however this can also be changed in the NotTheGrass-common.toml

## Requirements
* Minecraft 1.20.4
* Neoforge 20.4.80-beta+
